# Contributing

So you want to contribute to Argos? Awesome! Thank you in advance for your contribution. Here are a few guidelines that will help you along the way.

## What should I know before I get started?

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Marmelab Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [foss@marmelab.com](mailto:foss@marmelab.com).

## Asking Questions

Here, indicate the best way to ask questions: via a github issue, on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) ...

## Opening an Issue

If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/marmelab/argos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). You can search through existing issues and PRs to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.

Next, create a new issue that briefly explains the problem, and provides a bit of background as to the circumstances that triggered it, and steps to reproduce it.

### Issue Guidelines

Please use a succinct description. "doesn't work" doesn't help others find similar issues.

Please don't group multiple topics into one issue, but instead each should be its own issue.

And please don't just '+1' an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Argos is a community project, so pull requests are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers. In that case, prefix it with "[RFC]" (Request for Comments)

When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.

The core team prefix their PRs width "[WIP]" (Work in Progress) or "[RFR]" (ready for Review), don't hesitate to do the same to explain how far you are from completion.

When adding new features or modifying existing, please attempt to include tests to confirm the new behaviour.

### Coding style

You must follow the coding style of the existing files.

### Tests

```bash
make test
```
